Dear Editors,

Following your positive answer to our presubmission enquiry
(PBIOLOGY-D-12-04043), I would like to submit, on behalf of my co-authors, the
manuscript entitled “Developing a preprint culture in biology” for consideration
in the "Community Pages" of PLOS Biology. The manuscript is authored by myself,
Ethan White, Joel J. Adamson, Karthik Ram, Timothée Poisot, and Dominique
Gravel.

The text has ~2800 words, which is slightly more than the recommended 1600-2400
words. It is in part because of a section where we detail the current options
for biologists to submit their preprints. We think this section is useful since
it provides directions to scientists interested in submitting their preprints to
an open server. If necessary we are willing to reduce the size of the text
following your recommendations.

We look forward to your decision.

Best regards,
On behalf of the authors,

Philippe Desjardins-Proulx
Theoretical Ecosystem Ecology laboratory, Université du Québec, Canada.
