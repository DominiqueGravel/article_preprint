Dear Editors,

I would like to submit, on behalf of my co-authors, a proposal for an opinion
(?) entitled “Public preprints in ecology and evolution” for consideration in X.

    Public preprint servers such as arXiv.org allow researchers to make public
their research while it is undergoing peer-review. These servers are
increasingly seen as an important component of open science: the manuscripts can
be discussed by the scientific community as soon as they are finished instead of
being hidden until officially published. The quantitative biology section of
arXiv is growing faster than any other section, yet there is still much to do
to promote this practice in ecology and evolution. In this opinion piece, we
will make the argument for public preprints servers and discuss their current
status in
ecology and evolution. The article will be structured as follows:

1. The case for public preprints. In this first section, we make the case for
submitting preprints to public servers. We argue that this practice is
beneficial to both scientists and publishers and emphasize how it can be part of
a vigorous peer-review process.

2. Preprints, ecology and evolution. We discuss the current state of preprints in
ecology & evolution and the policies of the main publishers.
 
3. The current offer. Finally, we discuss the main options to submit preprints.
We briefly review arXiv, figshare, and the upcoming PeerJ and F1000Research.

    We look forward to your decision.

Best regards,

Philippe Desjardins-Proulx
